## Overview

The aim is to investigate the influence of educaion on the Industrial Revolution. This is persued through replicating the key findings of two seminal artiles:
* Becker, S. O., Hornung, E., and Woessmann, L. (2011). Education and catch-up in the Industrial Revolution. American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 3(3):92–126
* Squicciarini, M, N Voigtländer (2015). Human Capital and Industrialization: Evidence from the Age of Enlightenment, Quarterly Journal of Economics 30: 1825–1883.

## Conclusion
Both cases show that the impact of education was not uniform but depended on the specific needs, characteristics of industries, and the pace of technological innovation. Whether it was general literacy in Prussia or specialized knowledge in France, education's role was pivotal but context-dependent, reflecting the complexity of the intersection between human capital and indus-trial development. This shows that people need to keep learning and adapting. As different indus-tries grow and new technologies come up, the way we teach and learn also has to change to keep up with these developments. It's important to ensure that our education keeps pace with what's hap-pening in the world of work and technology.
